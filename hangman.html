I clear the canvas and withing the function I build the 'stand' for the man. To get the blanks of the word, I used a for loop that would push and underscore into a variable word.length times. For example of the word was "UP", the for loop would push two underscores in. Since in an array values are automatically seperated my commas, I used '.join(" ")' to have them seperated by a space. I then display this array of blanks in my canvas. Last but not least I cancel this event listener and I call my second event listener that will always lead to function that actually controls the game. */
